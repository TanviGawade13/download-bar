# Download Progress Bar (Practice Project)

A simple **download progress bar simulation** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
This project was created **only for practice purposes** to learn DOM manipulation, styling, and basic animations.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Dark-themed UI with a minimal card design.
* Progress bar smoothly fills from **0% to 100%**.
* Percentage text updates in real time.
* Final status changes to **“Downloaded”** when complete.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML** → page structure
* **CSS** → styling and dark theme
* **JavaScript** → progress logic with `setInterval()`

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The counter starts at `0%`.
2. Every few milliseconds, JavaScript increases the progress width and percentage.
3. Once the bar reaches `100%`, the title changes to **“Downloaded”** and the interval stops.

---

## 📂 Project Purpose

This is **not a real downloader**.
It is a **practice project** to understand:

* Updating DOM elements dynamically
* Handling intervals with JavaScript
* Creating a clean UI with CSS

---

## ▶️ Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. The progress bar will start filling automatically.
3. Wait until it reaches **100%** — then it shows **“Downloaded”**.

✅ Simple. Clean. Just for practice.
